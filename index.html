		<h1>Puzzler</h1>
		<p>This virtual reality application was created for the Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree. Within this app, I focused on mood, movement and user feedback. </p>
		<div id="process">
			<h2>Process</h2>
			<h3>Statement of Purpose</h3>
			<p>Puzzler is a mobile VR app that seeks to provide an introductory virtual reality gaming experience by tracking user’s gaze and input to memorize and replicate a pattern and complete a Simon type game. </p>

			<h3>Persona</h3>
			<p>This app is for someone in their mid-20s to late 30s. He or she is a professional with a recently released smartphone with Google Cardboard capabilities. He or she is likely a busy person who is looking for a fun experience to share with their friends. Puzzler may be one of their first mobile virtual reality experiences.</p>

			<h3>Sketches</h3>
			<p>For my initial version of the game, I wanted to experiment with scale. I wanted to “shrink” users to be smaller than the grass - small enough to go inside of a soda can. Initially, I considered adding another creature that would challenge the user to go inside and complete the puzzle.</p>
			<div class="gallery">
				<img src="images/sketch1.jpg">
			</div>
			<p>The inside of the can would contain the puzzle orbs and some sort of exit (a hole in the bottom of the can). Once outside there would be options for additional levels or difficulties. </p>
			<div class="gallery">

			<p>Here are some screenshots of my first attempt.</p>

			</div>

			<p>Due to time constraints and lack of Blender experience to make my own 3d models that would work with light maps, I decided to use the standard assets provided by Udacity instead. </p>

		<div class="userTesting">
			<h2>User Testing</h2>
			<h3>User Test #1: Mood and Scale</h3>
			<p>My first user test focused on the mood and scale of the environment. Based on user feedback, I scaled the room up a little bit. I wanted the room/dungeon to feel large. I also modified the lighting to give it more of a scary, mysterious mood.</p>

			</div>
			

			<h3>User Test #2: Movement and User Interface</h3>
			<p>The second user test focused on movement through the app as well as the start and ending UI menus. </p>
			<div class="gallery">
				<img src="images/draft2start.png">
			</div>
			<p>User feedback told me that a movement time of 2 seconds to get to each point was a good time. Users reported not feeling any simulator sickness, so I didn’t need to modify the movement at all. The UI screens were said to be intuitive and at a good distance for viewing.</p>

			<h3>User Test #3: The Complete Experience</h3>
			<p>The final user test was a test of the complete experience. Users started the game, played the game, and won. I wanted to add some additional challenge for my users, so I added the ability to increase the difficulty (length of pattern to memorize) of the game after winning it the first time. </p>

				<img src="images/draft3end.png">
			</div>

			<h3>Additional Testing</h3>
			<p>During my own testing, I decided to try a game with a pattern length of 18. I realized that if I was going to allow this addition in the game, I’d want to include a way for users to give up on the puzzle pattern they are working on. To accommodate this, I added a UI screen inside the dungeon.</p>
			<div class="gallery">
				<img src="images/draft4play.png">
				<img src="images/draft4end.png">
			</div>
			<p>This gave users some brief instructions, for those users that may not understand the gameplay. I also added a “Give up?” button. This button will let users out of the dungeon to get to another screen where they could lower the difficulty. </p>

		</div>
		<div class="outcomes">
			<h2>Outcomes</h2>
			<h3>Next Steps</h3>
			<p>Some additional features that can be added to this app is not only longer pattern sequences, but also different environments and orb arrangements. I may also consider adding additional materials and sounds so that each orb has a distinct sound and color. I may add additional environment details to the outside of the puzzle room. </p>
			<p>With a little more research and practice with Blender, I would like to finish working on my initial version of this project – the can. </p>

			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img src="images/profilepic.png" alt="Kristin Dragos">
			<p>I grew up in Illinois, moved to Arizona in 2013, and then California in December 2016. I have a BA in English with a minor in Psychology from Western Illinois University. In 2015, I discovered my desire to turn my love of technology into a career, and I've been coding ever since.</p>
			<p>In my previous life, I was a cosmetologist for 6 years and a teacher. I taught 4th and 5th grade students, as well as held various tutoring positions. In each of these roles I strived to bring technology into the classroom to individualize my teaching and engage my students. At the schools where I taught, I started and supervised a computer coding club for 5th graders that used Scratch from MIT, and supervised a FIRST Lego Robotics League for middle school students. It is through these clubs that I realized I wanted to do more with technology. In January 2015, I made the decision to attend Rockit Bootcamp in Tempe, Arizona. This 12 week immersive course had me working 40-60 hours per week on learning and practicing web development skills.</p>
			<p>In May 2016, I attended the Google I/O conference in Mountain View, CA. During that conference, I was inspired to start learning how to create virtual and augmented reality apps with Google's Tango technology. Since then, I've started working on my own projects including <a href="http://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.DragonSansCache.FracturePreludeV1">Fracture Break.</a></p>
			<p>In December 2016, I desided to start Udacity's Virtual Reality Developer Nanodegree program. I've been enjoying creating virtual reality experiences!</p>
