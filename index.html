		<h1>Puzzler</h1>
		<p>This virtual reality application was created for the Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree. Within this app, I focused on mood, movement and user feedback. </p>

			<h2>Process</h2>
			<h3>Statement of Purpose</h3>
			<p>Puzzler is a mobile VR app that seeks to provide an introductory virtual reality gaming experience by tracking user’s gaze and input to memorize and replicate a pattern and complete a Simon type game. </p>

			<h3>Persona</h3>
			<p>This app is for someone in their mid-20s to late 30s. He or she is a professional with a recently released smartphone with Google Cardboard capabilities. He or she is likely a busy person who is looking for a fun experience to share with their friends. Puzzler may be one of their first mobile virtual reality experiences.</p>

			<h3>Sketches</h3>
			<p>For my initial version of the game, I wanted to experiment with scale. I wanted to “shrink” users to be smaller than the grass - small enough to go inside of a soda can. Initially, I considered adding another creature that would challenge the user to go inside and complete the puzzle.</p>

			<p>The inside of the can would contain the puzzle orbs and some sort of exit (a hole in the bottom of the can). Once outside there would be options for additional levels or difficulties. </p>

			<p>Here are some screenshots of my first attempt.</p>

			<p>Due to time constraints and lack of Blender experience to make my own 3d models that would work with light maps, I decided to use the standard assets provided by Udacity instead. </p>
